              >
              Produce is a generalized term for many farm-produced crops,
              including fruits and vegetables (grains, oats, etc. are also
              sometimes considered produce). More specifically, the term produce
              often implies that the products are fresh and generally in the
              same state as where and when they were harvested.[citation needed]
              In supermarkets, the term is also used to refer to the section of
              the store where fruit and vegetables are kept. Produce is the main
              product sold by greengrocers (UK, Australia) and farmers' markets.
              The term is widely and commonly used in the U.S. and Canada, but
              is not typically used outside the agricultural sector in other
              English-speaking countries. In parts of the world, including the
              U.S., produce is marked with small stickers bearing price look-up
              codes. These four- or five-digit codes are a standardized system
              intended to aid checkout and inventory control at places where
              produce is sold.

                <span class="fw-bold">Elon Reeve Musk</span> FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/
                EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor.
                He is the founder, CEO and chief engineer of SpaceX; angel
                investor, CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; owner and
                CEO of Twitter, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; co-founder
                of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the philanthropic Musk
                Foundation. With an estimated net worth of around $139 billion
                as of December 23, 2022, primarily from his ownership stakes in
                Tesla and SpaceX,[4][5] Musk is the second-wealthiest person in
                the world, according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index
                and Forbes's real-time billionaires list.[6][7] Musk was born in
                Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended at the University
                of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 18, acquiring
                citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later,
                he matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the
                University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees
                in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to
                attend Stanford University. After two days, he dropped out and
                with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide
                software company Zip2. In 1999, Zip2 was acquired by Compaq for
                $307 million and Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com
                merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal, which eBay
                acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002. With $175.8 million, Musk
                founded SpaceX in 2002, a spaceflight services company. In 2004,
                he was an early investor in the electric vehicle manufacturer
                Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and
                product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In
                2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that
                was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he
                co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research
                company. The following year, he co-founded Neuralink—a
                neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces—and
                The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has also
                proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system.
                In 2022, his acquisition of Twitter for $44 billion was
                completed. Musk has made controversial statements on politics
                and technology, particularly on Twitter, and is a polarizing
                figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and
                misleading statements, including spreading COVID-19
                misinformation. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
                Commission (SEC) sued Musk for falsely tweeting that he had
                secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. Musk stepped
                down as chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine as part of
                a settlement agreement with the SEC.
